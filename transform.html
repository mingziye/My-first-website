        From the beginning, a convent has dismantled on the ground where the parasol locates, a bounded market<br><br>
    consisting of several buildings functioned here during the 19th Century until 1973 when the ensemble was<br><br>
     knock down. From that point on, the square was becoming a car park and possibility to construct an underground<br><br>
      carpark were suggested. In the progress of excavating the centre for constructing the underground car park, <br><br>
      a range of heritages had found which came from Imperial Rome and Late Antique and Islamic city. At the moment,<br><br>
       the square and car park were looks abandoned and old that the renovation and transformation were seems needed.<br><br>
        Then after Metropol Parasol replaced the archaeological site completely, it did attract residents and more <br><br>
        visitors for the waffle-like appearance and functions of the building that the huge parasol provides an archaeology<br><br>
         museum which exhibits the heritages being discovered underground, and a farmer market, plaza, restaurants, <br><br>
         bars and a panorama terrace on the upper level of the parasols. <br><br>

        However, Matropol parasol is run by its contractor which holds 40 years concession of the building. It is likely<br><br>
        that the contractor/s desire of profit which the parasol will bring in will conflict with its public propose.<br><br>
